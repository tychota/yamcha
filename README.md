An opinionated inline style for react library.

It is based on https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/.

It has CommonJS and UMD builds via Babel and Webpack, ESLint, and Mocha.
It also has React-friendly examples folder with library code mapped to 
the sources.

Note that this is an *opinionated* library. It is also still alpha.
